# Scattered and Gathered Israel
This is a fun project inspired by my class on the Scattering and Gathering of Israel,
taught by Dr. Jeffrey Chadwick. This chart helps show how today, we are each 
a descendant of basically all tribes of Israel. It also shows how restored teachings
fit into the narrative of the Gathering of Israel.
